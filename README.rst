Bugzilla
========

Weechat script that links to bugzilla bugs::

    17:51:59 Wraithan | We should really look into bug 800000 some more.
    17:51:59          | [http://bugzil.la/800000]

I plan to add the ability for the script to look up bugs and get summary/status
like firebot, since firebot isn't always around, but that is in the future,
right now linking is better than nothing.
